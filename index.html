        The navigation environment is a single-agent domain featuring discrete
        action-space and continuous state-space. It is a simulation of the
        autonomous navigation problem in robotics.
    </h2>
    <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
    <p>The environment provides two tasks:</p>
    <h4>Navigation</h4>
    <p>
        The goal of this environment is to navigate a robot on a track without
        crashing into the walls. Initially, the robot is placed randomly into
        the track but at a safe distance from the walls. The state-space
        consists of 5 range measurements. The action-space consists of 3
        actions (move_forward, rotate_left, rotate_right). Furthermore, both
        actions and states have additive white Gaussian noise. The robot is
        rewarded +5 for moving forward and -0.5 for rotating. If the robot
        crashes into the wall it is penalized with -200.
    </p>

    <h4>NavigationGoal</h4>
    <p>
        The goal of this environment is to navigate a robot to reach a goal
        location while avoiding the obstacles in the track. Initially, the
        robot is placed randomly into the track but at a safe distance from the
        obstacles. Both the goal and the obstacles change location in every
        episode. The state-space consists of 5 range measurements plus the
        distance and angle from the goal. The action-space consists of 3
        actions (move_forward, rotate_left, rotate_right). Furthermore, both
        actions and states have additive white Gaussian noise. The robot is
        rewarded +200 for reaching the goal and -200 for crashing. Moreover,
        after each time step, the robot is rewarded or penalized proportionally
        to the difference between the current and previous step distances from
        the goal.

    <h3 id="gettingStarted">Getting Started</h3>
    <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
    <p>
        The package was implemented and tested with Python 3.8 but previous
        versions
        can also be used.
    </p>
    <p>The following libraries need to be installed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>NumPy</li>
        <li>Matplotlib</li>
        <li>OpenAI Gym</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="installation">Installation</h4>
    <p>Install the package with:</p>
    <code>
        git clone https://github.com/NickGeramanis/gym-navigation <br>
        cd gym-navigation <br>
        pip3 install -e . <br>
    </code>
    <h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
    <p>
        You can use these environments in order to test and compare different
        reinforcement learning algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>You can create an instance of the environment with:</p>
    <code>
        import gym <br>
        <br>
        # Navigation Environment <br>
        env = gym.make('gym_navigation:Navigation-v0', track_id=1) <br>
    </code>
    <code>
        import gym <br>
        <br>
        # NavigationGoal Environment <br>
        env = gym.make('gym_navigation:NavigationGoal-v0', track_id=1) <br>
    </code>
    <p>Currently, only one track has been implemented in each environment.</p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, some unit tests have been implemented in folder
        <quote>tests</quote>
        to verify the proper functioning of the code.
